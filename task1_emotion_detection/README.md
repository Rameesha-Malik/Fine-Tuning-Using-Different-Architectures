#  Task 1 â€“ Emotion Detection Using BERT

this is my task 1 from **NLP / Machine Learning Project 2**.  
the goal was to train a BERT model that can detect emotions (joy, sadness, anger, neutral) from text.

## project overview  
in this task i fine-tuned a pre-trained **bert-base-uncased** model from hugging face on a labeled dataset of four emotions.  
after training, the model can predict the emotion behind any sentence or tweet-like text.

## dataset  
**source:** [Kaggle â€“ Emotion Categories (Neutral, Joy, Sadness, Anger)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faiqahmad01/emotion-categories-neutraljoysadnessanger)  
**total samples:** 22 050  

each record has:
- `content` â†’ the text sentence  
- `sentiment` â†’ numeric emotion label  

| label  | emotion   |
|--------|-----------|
| 0      | Joy       |
| 1      | Sadness   |
| 2      | Neutral   |
| 3      | Anger     |

split ratio:
- 80 % train  
- 10 % validation  
- 10 % test  

##  setup  
run this project on **Google Colab** or any python 3.10+ environment.  
install all needed packages first:

```
pip install transformers datasets torch scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn gradio
````

mount your drive and update the dataset paths in the notebook.

##  gradio demo

i built a simple interactive demo with **gradio** so anyone can test the model:
